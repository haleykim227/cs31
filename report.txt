Step 5: 
input "0" for "How many registered voters were surveyed?"
input "2" for "How many of them say they will vote for Newsom?"
input "3" for "How many of them say they will vote for Cox?"
There were no error messages displayed, and the build was successful.
The program stated that inf% would vote for Newsom, that inf% would vote for Cox, and that Cox is predicted to win the election.
Obviously, the results were nonsensical.

Step 6:
logic error: changed the multiplication to division on line 20 after 100.0
There were no error messages, and the build was successful.
Results were incorrect, as when input 10, 3, and 7, the result was that 3.3% would vote for Newsom and that 70.0% would vote for Cox. The correct answers would have been 30.0% and 70.0%.

Step 7:
compile error: 
1) deleted a semicolon after line 20
2) deleted a curly bracket at the end of the program on line 34
An error message indicating "Build Failed" as well as error messages on line 20 and line 34 stating "Expected ; at the end of declaration" and "Expected '}'"
There were no results since the build was unsuccessful.
